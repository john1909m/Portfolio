            <p className='text-lg'>Hey!ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a Front-End Developer, Graphic Designer, and Motion Designer who loves bringing ideas to life through clean code and eye-catching design. I focus on creating smooth, user-friendly websites and visuals that feel modern and meaningful.

I work with tools like React, Figma, After Effects, and have a solid foundation in Linux. I enjoy combining design and development to create experiences that are both functional and visually engaging.

Iâ€™m always curious, always improving, and always looking for new ways to make digital work more creative, more useful, and more fun. Whether itâ€™s a simple animation or a full web app, Iâ€™m all in on the details that make a big difference.</p>
